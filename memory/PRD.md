# PRD — Nagpal's House of Beauty (Salon Furniture Landing Page)

## Original Problem Statement
User provided a static HTML landing page for "Nagpal's House of Beauty", a Delhi-based salon furniture supplier (styling chairs, shampoo/wash units, workstations, trolleys, mirrors; pan-India delivery, retail + bulk). User then requested an Awwwards-level rebuild inspired by salonfurniture.in: bolder-but-sleeker typography, big furniture photography hero, Explore Now button scrolling to an all-categories section, partners logo wall, rotating category-product selector, warm brown-toned furniture gallery, bigger Instagram section, brand name in CAPS, WhatsApp-based enquiries, placeholder contact numbers for now.

## Architecture
- Frontend: React 19 + Tailwind + framer-motion (scroll reveals, masked headline, AnimatePresence) + lenis (smooth momentum scroll). Single-page site, section anchors.
- Backend: FastAPI template retained (health endpoint only; no backend features requested).
- Content: centralized in `/app/frontend/src/data/content.js` (contact info, categories, spotlights, products, partners, gallery, Instagram grid) — single edit point for the user.
- Design system: `/app/design_guidelines.json` — obsidian/deep forest green + ivory + antique brass, Syne display + Karla body.

## User Personas
- Salon owner furnishing a new salon (bulk buyer) — wants categories, specs, WhatsApp quote fast.
- Stylist upgrading one or two pieces (retail buyer).
- Interior designer sourcing furniture for a client salon.

## Core Requirements (static)
- Home/hero with big furniture imagery + Explore Now → #all-categories

- Partners wall, rotating category selector, brown-toned gallery, large Instagram block
- All enquiries via WhatsApp deep links (wa.me with pre-filled text)

## Implemented (2026-07-08, update 2)
